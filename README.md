# 🏥 Analyzing Healthcare Data in Power BI  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is an **Interactive Healthcare Analytics Dashboard** built in **Power BI**.  
It focuses on analyzing hospital and patient data to provide insights into demographics, admissions, readmissions, and hospital performance.  

The use case was inspired by the **Analyzing Healthcare Data in Power BI course on DataCamp**, and it demonstrates how data visualization can help healthcare organizations make data-driven decisions.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Track patient demographics (age, gender, admission type).  
- Analyze hospital resource utilization and length of stay.  
- Monitor readmission rates and discharge patterns.  
- Provide management with an interactive dashboard for better healthcare planning.  

---

## 📊 Data  
The dataset includes healthcare-related attributes such as:  
- **Patient Details**: Patient ID, Age, Gender, Admission Type.  
- **Hospitalization Metrics**: Length of Stay, Discharge Date, Readmission Flag.  
- **Operational Data**: Department, Treatment Cost, Utilization Rates.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques  
- **Power BI**: Data cleaning, modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard building.  
- **DAX Functions**:  
  - `CALCULATE()` for filtering and KPI measures.  
  - `USERELATIONSHIP()` for managing multiple date fields.  
  - Time intelligence (`YEAR`, `MONTH`, `WEEKNUM`) for trends analysis.  

---

## 🔑 Key Features of the Dashboard  
- **Patient Demographics**: Distribution by age group, gender, and admission type.  
- **Hospital Performance**: Average length of stay, treatment costs, utilization rates.  
- **Readmissions Analysis**: Identifying patterns and high-risk groups.  
- **Interactive Filters**: Ability to slice data by department, admission type, or time period.

## 🚀 Insights  
- Older patients (65+) tend to have longer average stays.  
- Emergency admissions contribute most to high readmission rates.  
- Certain departments show higher utilization, indicating resource pressure.  
- Cost per patient varies significantly across departments.  

---

## ✅ Outcome  
This Healthcare Analytics dashboard enables hospital managers and healthcare professionals to:  
- Optimize resource allocation.  
- Improve patient care by monitoring readmission patterns.  
- Reduce costs by identifying inefficiencies.  
- Support evidence-based decision-making.  

---

## 🔮 Next Steps  
- Add predictive modeling for patient readmission risk.  
- Integrate real hospital EHR data for live insights.  
- Automate refresh to connect with healthcare databases.
